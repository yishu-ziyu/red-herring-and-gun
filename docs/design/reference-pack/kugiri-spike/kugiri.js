// kugiri: a text splitter that keeps the lines the browser painted. Lines are read off the text itself
// (`Range.getClientRects()` per word) and cut with `Range.extractContents()`, so nothing about the
// layout changes before it is measured; words and graphemes are wrapped inside those lines, under
// `text-wrap: nowrap`, so their inline-block boxes can never move a wrap either. Only text is split:
// an inline piece that is not text (an icon, a chip, an ignored element) is never cut into and rides
// along inside its line, and a block-level one (a media tile, a button row, a table, hidden
// content) is left exactly where it is and is no unit at all. A float is put back in front of the
// line it floated beside, so the lines still flow around it and nothing animates it.
//
// Two phases, never interleaved: every layout and style read happens first, against a layout that
// is still clean, and every DOM write after, so a split of a whole article forces no reflow at all.
// Several targets passed together are planned whole before any is written, so a page of blocks
// costs the one layout a single block does, where a loop of splits would force one per block.
//
// The split only structures and marks: every unit carries `data-line`, `data-word` or `data-char`
// with its index, the same index as a custom property (`--line`, `--word`, `--char`) for a CSS
// stagger, and a mask carries `data-mask`; the target carries `data-split` and the counts
// (`--lines`, `--words`, `--chars`). The consumer owns the animation, in CSS or in script.
//
// Dependency-free on purpose: it ships to other projects as-is.
